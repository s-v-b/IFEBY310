##  Course logistics

- 24 hours = 2 hours $\times$ *12 weeks* : classes + hands-on

- [Agenda](https://edt.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/#/parcours/mathinfo/m1)


### About the hands-on

- Hands-on and homeworks using  `Jupyter/Quarto` notebooks
  
- Using a `Docker` image {{< fa brands docker >}} built for the course

- {{< fa laptop-code >}} Hands-on must be carried out using your *own laptop*



##  Course logistics

- {{< fa globe >}} course : [https://s-v-b.github.io/IFEBY310](https://s-v-b.github.io/IFEBY310)

- {{< fa bookmark >}} Bookmark it !

- {{< fa tools >}} Follow the steps described on the `tools` page:

<center>
[https://s-v-b.github.io/IFEBY310/tools](https://s-v-b.github.io/IFEBY310/tools)
</center>

- Use {{< fa brands docker >}} 

##  Course evaluation

- *Evaluation* using **homeworks** and a **final project**

- Find a *friend*: all work done by **pairs of students**

- **All your work** goes in your private git repository and nowhere else: *no emails* !

- All your homework will be using [`quarto` files](https://quarto.org)

#  {{< fa brands docker >}} `Docker`   {background-color="#1c191c"}


##  Why [`docker`](https://www.docker.com) ? What is it ?

- Don't mess with your `python` env. and configuration files
- Everything in embedded in a *container* (better than a Virtual Machine)
- A *container* is an **instance** of an *image*
- Same image = same environment for everybody 
- Same image = no {version, dependencies, install} problems
- It is an *entreprise standard* used everywhere now!

##  Latency numbers

- Reading 1MB from **disk** = **100 x** reading 1MB from **memory**

- Sending packet from **US to Europe to US** = **1 000 000 x** main memory reference

### General tendency

True in general, not always:

- memory operations : *fastest*

- disk operations : *slow*

- network operations : *slowest*

#  Challenges  {background-color="#1c191c"}



##  Challenges with big datasets


- Large data *don't fit* on a **single** hard-drive

- **One** large (and expensive) machine *can't process or store* **all** the data

- For **computations** how do we *stream data* from the **disk to the different 
layers of memory** ?

- **Concurrent accesses** to the data: disks *cannot* be **read in parallel**




##  Solutions

- Combine *several machines* containing **hard drives** and **processors** on a **network**

- Using *commodity hardware*: cheap, common architecture i.e. **processor** + **RAM** + **disk**

- *Scalability* = **more machines** on the network

- *Partition* the data across the machines




##  Challenges

Dealing with distributed computations adds **software complexity**

Scheduling
: How to *split the work across machines*? Must exploit and optimize data locality since moving data is very expensive

Reliability
: How to *handle  failures*? Commodity (cheap) hardware fails more often. @Google [1%, 5%] HD failure/year and 0.2% [DIMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM) failure/year 

Uneven performance of machines
: some nodes are slower than others

## {{< fa jedi >}} and {{< fa brands google >}}

> Google committed to a number of key tenants when designing its data center architecture. Most significantly —and at the time, uniquely— Google committed to massively parallelizing and distributing
processing across very large numbers of commodity servers. 

> Google also adopted a “Jedis build their own
lightsabers” attitude: very little third party —and virtually no commercial— software would be found in the Google architecture. 

> *Build* was considered better than *buy* at Google.

##  The Big Data universe

Many technologies combining *software* and *cloud computing*

<center>
  <img src="/images/teasing2.jpg" style="width: 100%;" />

##  The Big Data universe (still expanding)

Often used with/for with *Machine Learning* (or AI)

<center>
  <img src="/images/teasing3.png" style="width: 90%;" />
</center>



##  Tools {{< fa tools >}}

- Softwares such as `HadoopMR` (Hadoop Map Reduce) and more recently  `Spark` and `Dask`  cope with these challenges
- They are *distributed computational engines*: softwares that ease the development of distributed algorithms

They run on *clusters* (several machine on a network), managed by a *resource manager* such as :

- {{< fa brands yarn >}} Yarn : 
[https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html)
- Kubernetes :  [https://kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/)

A resource manager ensures that the tasks running on the cluster do not try to use the same resources all at once









#  `Apache Spark`     {background-color="#1c191c"}



##  Apache `Spark`  {.smaller}

The course will focus mainly on `Spark` for big data processing

<center>
  <img src="/images/spark.png" style="width: 35%;" />

  [https://spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org)
</center>

- `Spark` is an *enterprise standard* <br>
(cf [https://spark.apache.org/powered-by.html](https://spark.apache.org/powered-by.html))
- One of the most used *big data processing framework*
- *Open source*

The predecessor of `Spark` is [`Hadoop`](ttps://hadoop.apache.org)

See Chapter 2 in [Next Generation Dabases](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-1329-2)

[Guy Harrison](https://www.guyharrison.net)



##  [`Hadoop`](ttps://hadoop.apache.org)

- `Hadoop` has a simple API and good fault tolerance (tolerance to nodes failing midway through a processing job)

- The cost is lots of *data shuffling* across the network

- With intermediate computations *written to disk* *over the network* which we know is *very time expensive* 

It is made of three components:

- `HDFS` (Highly Distributed File System) inspired from `GoogleFileSystem`, see 
[https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub51](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub51)

- {{< fa brands yarn >}}`YARN` (Yet Another Ressource Negociator) for processing management.

- `MapReduce` inspired from Google for processing again.<br> [https://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html](https://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html)


##

> The Hadoop 1.0 architecture is powerful and easy to understand, but it is limited to MapReduce
workloads and it provides limited flexibility with regard to scheduling and resource allocation. 

> In the Hadoop 2.0 architecture, YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator or, recursively, YARN Application Resource
Negotiator) improves scalability and flexibility by splitting the roles of the Task Tracker into two processes.

> A *Resource Manager* controls access to the clusters resources (memory, CPU, etc.) while the *Application
Manager* (one per job) controls task execution.

##  `Spark`  {.smaller}

Advantages of `Spark` over `HadoopMR` ?

- *In-memory storage*: use **RAM** for fast iterative computations
- *Lower overhead* for starting jobs
- *Simple and expressive* with `Scala`, `Python`, `R`, `Java` APIs
- *Higher level libraries* with `SparkSQL`, `SparkStreaming`, etc.

Disadvantages of `Spark` over `HadoopMR` ?
 
- `Spark` requires servers with **more CPU** and **more memory**
- But still much cheaper than HPC

`Spark` is *much faster* than `Hadoop`

- `Hadoop` uses **disk** and **network** 
- `Spark` tries to use **memory** as much as possible for operations while minimizing network use

- [https://mesos.apache.org](https://mesos.apache.org): Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively. Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos
kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch) with API’s for
resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

- [https://kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io) Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
